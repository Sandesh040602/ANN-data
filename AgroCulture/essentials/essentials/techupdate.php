            <br>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Analyzing the area: This identifies the territory being tested. Therefore, the first step includes
                    establishing a boundary, analyses of the area, and then finally, uploading the technical GPS
                    information into the drone's navigation system.
                </li>
                <li>Using Autonomous Drones: Since Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are independent, they enter flight
                    patterns into their already established system to collect required data. </li>
                <li> Uploading the data: After capturing all the required data through sensors such as the multispectral
                    sensor/RGB sensor, it is processed through numerous software for further analysis and
                    interpretation.</li>
                <li>Output: After collecting the data, they format it so that farmers can understand the data with no
                    hassle, bringing them a step closer to precision farming. 3D mapping or Photogrammetry are popular
                    methods to display extensive data collected.</li>

            <p><strong>FEATURES OF DRONES IN AGRICULTURE : </strong></p>
            <br>
            <ol type="1">
                <li><strong>Irrigation Monitoring </strong>: Drones, including hyperspectral, thermal, or
                    multispectral sensors, recognize areas that are too dry or need improvement by the farmer. Drone
                    survey helps improve water efficiency and disclose potential pooling/leaks in irrigation by
                    providing Irrigation monitoring yields calculations of the vegetation index to help realize the
                    health of crops and emitted heat/energy.</li>
                <li><strong>Crop health monitoring </strong>: It is crucial to track the health of the vegetation
                    and spot bacterial/fungal plagues in the early stages. Agriculture drones can see which plants
                    reflect different amounts of green light and Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) light. This data
                    helps produce multispectral images to track crop health. Quick monitoring and discoveries of any
                    defects can help save crops. In circumstances of crop failure, the farmer can also document the
                    damages for accurate insurance claims.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Crop damage assessment </strong>: Agricultural drones fitted along with multispectral
                    sensors and RGB sensors also detect field areas inflicted by weeds, infections, and pests.
                    According to this data, the exact amounts of chemicals needed to fight these infestations are
                    known, and this helps diminish the costs inflicted by the farmer.</li>
                <li><strong>Field Soil analysis </strong>: The drone survey allows farmers to obtain information
                    about their land's soil conditions. Multispectral sensors allow seizing data useful for seed
                    planting patterns, thorough field soil analysis, irrigation, and nitrogen-level management.
                    Precise Photogrammetry/ 3D mapping permits farmers to analyze their soil conditions thoroughly.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Livestock tracking </strong>: The drone survey allows the farmers not to keep track of
                    their crops only but also monitor the movements of their cattle. Thermal sensor technology helps
                    find lost animals and detect an injury or sickness. Drones can carry out this function
                    favorably, and this adds comprehensively to the production of vegetation.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="para1"><br><br>Farmers must understand the entire process. Determination of goals, creating an
            equilibrium in the drone and software utilized, and being familiar with the principles of using such
            technology will stand as a challenge. The farmers will inevitably need comprehensive training or
            partnerships with third-party experts in the drone industry for the acquisition of reliable data. Drones
            have changed the course of obtaining data in almost every type of industry, and will only deem to become
            bigger and better in the coming years.</p>

            <br>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>IoT-based smart farming is a system built to monitor the agricultural land with the help of sensors
                    (soil moisture, humidity, light, temperature, etc.) and automate the irrigation practices. The
                    farmers can observe the field conditions from anywhere. For example, it will alert the farmer when
                    the soil moisture level is low; the farmer can use sensors to initiate irrigation. IoT-based smart
                    farming is highly efficient in contrast to traditional methods.
                </li>
                <li>Precision farming is the most common application of IoT in farming. It makes the agricultural
                    practices more precise and well-planned by including processes like real-time crop and soil
                    condition monitoring, plant health tracking, and weather prediction. The farmers can administer
                    their fields based on the insights obtained by this system. </li>
                <li> the IoT-integrated Artificial Intelligence system can give up-to-date alerts and data to optimize
                    crop growth processes and to reduce yield loss because of pests, detrimental soil moisture level, or
                    weather damages. This farming method assures precise usage of resources and increases field
                    productivity while maintaining the sustainability of the process.</li>
                <li>IoT-equipped irrigation systems not only conserve water but also ensure that crops are getting just
                    the right amount of water for their optimum growth. This method of irrigation relies on the soil
                    moisture level rather than pre-determined interval-based irrigation.</li>

                    with the agriculture sector to help farmer’s financial security and crop insurance. The company has
                    mobile apps for giving information on supply statistics of crops and crop stressing in their area.
                    This aids with deciding what to sow, when to irrigate or add fertilizers, or prepare for harvest.
                    Currently, the startup’s solutions are used by the Andhra Pradesh State Government.</li>

                <li>India is a world leader in agriculture, with about 52%* of the country's land used for farming
                    (against a world average of about 11%). Producing enough food for India's growing population is
                    becoming a major issue.
                </li>
                <li> As the country develops, the needs for agricultural production to provide the rising population
                    with a stable food supply and greater yield are increasing every day.
                </li>
                <li>Therefore, farmers who once relied on manual labor to tend to their vast fields are now turning to
                    machinery in the quest for greater efficiency.</li>
                <li>When the team visited India for the first time, they saw tractors riding all over public roads. The
                    style in India is to use tractors not only for farming, but also for daily transportation, moving
                    goods, and a wide range of other uses. Some tractors were riding with heavy cargo spilling off the
                    trailer, making the front wheels float off the ground.
                </li>
                <li>Some were mounted on huge combine harvesters, with the tractor output used as a power source for the
                    harvesting and running functions of the combine harvester. </li>
